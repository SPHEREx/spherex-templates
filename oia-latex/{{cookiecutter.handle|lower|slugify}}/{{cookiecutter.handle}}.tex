\section{Overview}

This is the Operational Interface Agreement between the SPHEREx Science Data Center (SSDC)
and {{ cookiecutter.partner -}}.
% Note that due to subtle conventions in English usage you may wish to add
% "the" before the partner organization's name, or spell it out in full,
% in the previous sentence, and in the next paragraph, depending on the partner.

\subsection{Scope}

% State what this document covers authoritatively and what it does not cover.
% For example (change if necessary):

This document covers the type, frequency, and manner of data exchanges between
the SSDC and {{ cookiecutter.partner -}}, but does not define the details of
the format of the data exchanged.
That is deferred to other documents.

% ... which should be referenced below!

\subsection{Nomenclature}

The SPHEREx Science Data Center (SSDC) is an organization located at
the California Institute of Technology / IPAC and is responsible for the
SPHEREx Level~1--3 science data processing and archiving.

% Add to or edit this list as necessary:

\begin{description}
  \item[ADCS]  Attitude Determination and Control System: a component of
    the SPHEREx spacecraft responsible for maintaining the orientation of
    the spacecraft in orbit and its pointing at designated targets.
  \item[FITS]  Flexible Image Transport System: an IAU standard for the
    representation of astronomical images in files.
  \item[IVOA]  International Virtual Observatory Alliance: an international
    forum for establishing standards for interoperability of astronomical
    data products and services.
  \item[LVF]   Linear Variable Filter: a type of optical filter in which the
    bandpass varies continuously across the filter.
  \item[SUR]   Sample-Up-the-Ramp: the readout method used for the SPHEREx
    detectors, in which the detector is read out at an approximately 1.5s
    cadence and the resulting pixel values are fitted with a slope
    representing the uncalibrated flux incident on the pixel.
\end{description}
