\section{VA Closure Summary}

% Summary of activity, including a list of objectives/success criteria and
% whether each was met (or justification for failure). Discuss any deviations
% from original verification approach (including hardware config deviations,
% venue changes, etc.) and why those are ok. If relevant, discuss process
% details and who was involved in the process and closure approval.
% See examples in Alfresco folder.

\section{Summary of Configuration} % (tests/demonstrations only; delete section if N/A)

\subsection{Hardware Configuration}

\subsection{SSDC Software Version}

\subsection{Additional Software Versions} % (if applicable)

\section{Key Inputs and Assumptions} % (analyses and/or inspections only; delete section if N/A)

% Inputs obtained from supporting and configuration-controlled documents such as
% spacecraft activity flows. Any applicable assumptions made in performing the analysis.
% Questions to consider:
%   * Does this analysis link to any higher or lower-level analyses or tests?
%     What are those inputs?  Are there any relevant or critical outputs?
%   * What assumptions are made in the analysis?
%   * How are test, analysis and model uncertainties handled? (There could
%     be general uncertainties on the inputs and/or uncertainties or
%     simplifications on the models themselves, which could result in
%     uncertainties in the outputs.)
%   * What is configuration controlled and how?
%   * For models used in the analysis, has that model been validated and how?
